ML Clinic is a website which allows users (doctors) to be registered
the registered doctors can then register patients and input and save thier bio-data and other medical
measures on the patient's health status. The web app can then be used to predict whether a patient is 
likely to have: (a) breast cancer (b) diabetes.

## Machine Learning Model and Evaluation

## Model Used:
The Logistic Regression Model was used for this work.

## Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy score was used to evaluate the Machine learning model.

## Limitation of the Project:
The project was aimed at showing how I can integrate my ML skills with my web development skills and may not contain any sophistication as may be observee in either fields.
