# ML Clinic
ML Clinic is a web app which allows users (doctors) to be registered -
the registered doctors can then register patients and input and save thier bio-data and other medical
measures on the patient's health status. The web app can then be used to predict whether a patient is 
likely to have: (a) breast cancer (b) diabetes. 
 
## Technologies used:
1. Python:
   - Django (templates, ORM)
2. JavaScript (Vanila):
   - Ajax 
3. Html:
4.css

## Machine Learning 
packages used:
1. Python:
   - Sklearn
   - numpy
   - pandas

### Data:
1. Breast Cancer Dataset and 
2. Diabetes Data set 

### Data Source:
[Machine Learning Repository]()

### Model Used:
The Logistic Regression Model was used for this work.

### Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy score was used to evaluate the Machine learning model.

### Limitation of the Project:
The project was aimed at showing how I can integrate my ML skills with my web development skills and may not contain any sophistication as may be observee in either fields.
